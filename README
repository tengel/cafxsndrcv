* cafxsnd 


Send file to a Casio Algebra FX. Sending more than one file is not
supported yet. The local filename also becomes the filename on the calculator.
Extensions to filenames separated with a dot ('.') are truncated.

usage: cafxsnd -hVvd<device> -s<file> 
   -s file              send file to calculator
   -h                   print help and exit
   -V                   print version information and exit
   -v                   verbose mode
   -d device            device where the Calculator ist connected to
			(default is /dev/ttyS0)
Example: 
sending NEWTON.cafx to /dev/ttyS0 (on the calc, you'll find the file NEWTON):
	cafxsnd -s NEWTON.cafx
sending NEWTON.cafx to /dev/ttyS1
	cafxsnd -s NEWTON.cafx -d /dev/ttyS1




* cafxrcv


Receive data from a 'Casio Algebra FX 2.0' calculator.

usage: cafxrcv -hVvd<device>
   -h                   print help and exit
   -V                   print version information and exit
   -v                   verbose mode
   -d device            device where the Calculator ist connected to
			(defualt is /dev/ttyS0)
